# React Weather

Weather App created with React, Typescript & Styled-Components
https://github.com/GabrielvonPlaten/ts-react-boilerplate was used as the boilerplate.
Website: http://reactweatherapi.surge.sh/

## Why Typescript?

I built this website for the purpose of learning Typescript and Styled Components. I like to start small when using a new technology.
